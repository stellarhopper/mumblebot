# What it Is #
Mumblebot is a small program which sits on a Mumble server and provides an interface between the Mumble server and user-defined scripts, much like an IRC bot.

# What it Does #
On its own, next to nothing.  The power of mumblebot comes with the ability to execute external scripts on user input.  You can write scripts in any language to interact with users on the server.  The whole project started in an attempt to split users into teams transparently and fairly.  You could also use it for automated announcements, a knowledge store, stats, or whatever you'd like.

In addition to that, mumblebot can connect to a server and retrieve a list of channels and/or users.

# Development #
mumblebot is being developed on OpenBSD.  It may run on other systems.  With enough chanting and incense, it may even run on Windows.  Feel free to give it a try.
